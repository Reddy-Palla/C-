C++
------------
-> c++ is an extension and implementation of new features in c language
-> It is object-oriented programming language. because it organizes code into objects, which are modules that contains code and functions .

Object- Oriented programming:
-----------------------
It is a methodology that helps to organize complex programs through the use of Inheritance, Encapsulation & polymorphism.

Compile-time
------------
It is the period when the programming code is converted in to  the machine code.


Run-time
------
It is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.
 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class:  It is a blueprint that defines the variables and methods.  

Object: It is instance (or) physical existance of a class (or ) real world entity of a class.

Member functions : functions inside the class are called as member functions.

         c                                          c++
      --------                                    --------
 1) Procedual oriented                        1) Object oriented
 2) Data is secured                           2) Secured
 3) Access specifiers are not present         3) are present
 4)not strict type check                      4)  strict type check
 5) function driven                           5) object driven
 6)Access modifiers are present               6) not present

     
eg: code

 #include<iostream>       // input and output stream
 using namespace std;  
 int main()                  // without int main generates error
 {
   int x;
   cout<<"enter the x value"<<endl;
   cin>>x<<endl;
   cout<<x<<endl;
}

 ">>"  this is excretion operator.
 "<<"  this is insertion operator.
 
 "endl"  this is for next line.

Scope resolution operator:
----------------------------
uses:-
      
   1)To access the global variables when local variable with same name.
   2)To define the function outside of a class.
   3)To access the class static variables.
   4)In case of multiple inheritance.


eg:
 1)#include<iostream>                           2)#include<iostream>                                          3)#include<iostream>
  using namespace std;                             using namespace std;                                          using namespace std;
  int n=90;                                        class test               // test is class name                class test
  int main()                                       {                                                             {
  {                                                     int num;                                                   int num;
     int n=10;                                            public:                                                   static void display()
    cout<<n<<endl;    // prints 10                        void show();                                              {
    cout<<::n<<endl;  // prints 90                  };                                                                cout<<"hi"<<endl;
  }                                              void test::show()            // defining out side the class        }
                                                 {                                                               };
                                                    cout<<"hello"<<endl;                                        int main()
                                                 }                                                              {
                                                 int main()                                                                 test::display();  // prints hi
                                                 {                                                               }
                                                     test t;   // t is object of class test
                                                   t.show();   // function calling with object
                                                 }


Namespace:
------------
It is a feature in c++ that allows you to group related identifiers (like classes, functions, variables etc)under a common name to avoid naming conflicts.
-> It prevents naming clashes in large projects. 

Features of c++:   
-----------------
a)Encapsulation
b)data abstraction
c)polymorphism
d)Inheritance


a)Encapsulation :-
---------
wrapping up of data and functions in to single unit is called Encapsulation.

Advantage :Data security.
